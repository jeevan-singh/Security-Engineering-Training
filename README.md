# Security Engineering Training
This training is an `Introduction to Security Engineering` and we will perform a deep dive into the various areas within the field.  The training itself has an Application Security slant, but we will cover topics of Cloud and Corporate Security.

## What is the goal of this training?
I have been bitten by the Security bug very early on in my career, but I didn't have a mechanism to learn more.  Today there are countless YouTube videos, security documentation and tools, but it is really difficult to find the signal from all that noise.

The purpose of this training is to consolidate my understanding of this field and to share it with the next generation of Security Engineers.  I have found `signals` among the noise and I want to reduce the time that it will take for others to find signals.

The secondary purpose is to expose you to the field of Security Engineering.  Many folks approach me and ask `How can I become a Security Engineer?`, but the question that they should ask is `Should I become a Security Engineer?`.  This training will help guide you toward an answer.  

If you do enjoy the training and want to move forward in the field, we will talk about the different strategies you can use to break in.  It is very difficult to break into Security, but there are tips and techniques that will help you make the transition.

## Will I get a Security Engineering job by completing this training?
No, this training is provided by a random person (me) on the internet and I am not accredited.  As mentioned, breaking into Security is very hard, but this training can be your first steps into Security Engineering.  Perhaps you will be the Developer or DevOps person in your organization known for your security acumen, which I hope can translate to a launchpad into a career in this wonderful field.
