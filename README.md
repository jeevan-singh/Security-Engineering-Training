# Security Engineering Training
This training is an `Introduction to Security Engineering` and we will perform a deep dive into the various areas within the field.  

## What is the goal of this training?
I have been bitten by the Security bug very early on in my career, but I didn't have an easy way to learn more.  Today there are countless YouTube videos, Security documentation and Security tools, but it can be difficult to discover signal within all the noise.

The purpose of this training is to consolidate my understanding of this field and to share it with the next generation of Security Engineers.  I have found some `signals` and I want to reduce the time that it will take for others to find them.  I also want to give a wider prespective into what Security Engineering is and the paths that one can take.

The secondary purpose is to expose more people to the field of Security Engineering, ideally attracting those that fall within minority groups.  The more diversity we have within Security, the better our industry becomes.  Diversity brings more ideas to the table and makes everyone stronger and better.  I go into much deeper details in the Threat Modeling training

Many folks approach me and ask `How can I become a Security Engineer?`, but the question that they should ask is `Should I become a Security Engineer?`.  This training will help guide you toward an answer.  

If you do enjoy the training and want to move forward in the field, we will talk about the different strategies you can use to break in.  It can be difficult to break into Security, but there are tips and techniques that will help you make the transition.

## Will I get a Security Engineering job by completing this training?
No, this training is provided by a random person (me) on the internet and I am not accredited.  

As mentioned, breaking into Security is very hard, but this training can be your baby steps into the industry.  Hopefully you can use it to broaden your skillsets within your current role.
