# Risk Exercise
In this first exercise, we want to understand your internal risk tolerance.  Please answer the following questions.

Questions
1. Rate your risk tolerance (High, Medium, Low) and why did you rate it as such?
2. What is the riskiest thing that you did during the pandemic? 
3. What is a risk that you considered, but you ultimately didn't do due to the risk?
4. What is a risk that you would never consider, but someone close to you did it?
