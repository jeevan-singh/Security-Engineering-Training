## Disciplines Exercise
In this third exercise, let's use our skills to assign a priority to the below vulnerabilities.  Try to understand the risk that they pose to the organization.  

You have found out that you are susceptiable to the following vulnerabilities, please assign it a Critical, High, Medium, Low, Informational prioritization.

| Number | Scenario  |
|:--------|:----------|
|1. | You have discovered a Windows XP machine running in one of your environments, it is needed to run a critical legacy report for the Finance team. The IT team is aware of the risk and has ensured that the Finance team does not have access it and that IT runs the report and sends back the results to the Finance team.  The machine is also on a completely separate internal network and it cannot access any device in the corporate network.  |
|2. | There is a SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability in your application, this SQLi vulnerability will give complete control of the database, but in order to do so, the adversary will need to be logged in as an admin in your application.  Please note that all admins have strong passwords and multi-factor authentication enabled on their accounts.|
|3. |A security researcher has discovered a reflective cross-site scripting vulnerability on the login page.  This vulnerability will allow the adversary to run arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code on your login page.|
|4. |Your webserver is old and it is susceptiable to a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability, the adversary only needs to send a specific payload to your webserver, which is already available to the internet.|
|5. |Your application does not have a Content Security Policy enabled.  Content Security Policies make it considerably more difficult for an adversary to exploit Cross-site Scripting vulnerabilities (XSS) on your application.  Please note that your application has numerous other controls to help prevent XSS vulnerabilities, but researchers end up finding XSS vulnerabilities once in a while.|
